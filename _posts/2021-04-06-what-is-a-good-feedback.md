title: "What is a good feedback?"

In my opinion, the most important dos are being constructive in giving feedback
and being more detailed when taking look at others work. For most of us, it is gladder
to see positive feedbacks. Being constructive not only points out problems in the work
but also motivates the person to improve. Being more detailed helps me figure out
more problems, either in terms of correctness of solution or style of the work. I think
being more detailed is being responsible for me and the person I am assessing, since
the process of finding his/her problem also makes me more familiar with course
materials.
Therefore, only taking a glance at others work and providing very general
suggestions automatically becomes a don’t. Since in this way, neither peers can be
fully aware of what they should do next in order to improve their works nor I can
have the chance to learn something from checking others’ works.
The thing that makes my peer’s review most valuable to me is it provides me a
more comprehensive view at my work. When thinking of a problem, I often stick to
only one way of solving it, while peers might have different opinions or some new
insights, which could help me think of the problem in an easier way or some other
ways that makes me realize: “Oh, I could’ve got the same solution by this approach!”.
