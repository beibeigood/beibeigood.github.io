	<p><h2>Projects<h2>
		<h3>Machine Learning via Python</h3>
		<br>The projects aim at implemeting machine learning algorithms via Python, to either achieve supervised or unsupervised 
		<br>learning. The first one aims at binary classification and the second one aims at discrete classification.
		<br>- Implemented both Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model and Logistic Regression Model to binary classify movie reviews(negative
		<br>  or positive) by analyzing words they use. Both of the models analyzed data from IMDB with length-1000 characteristic
		<br>  vector and achieved an accuracy of 90 percent.
		<br>- Implementing K-Means Model and the Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster data. More specifically, to unsupervisedly learn
		<br>  and label the type of a flower given its characteristc vector(i.e. its length, etc).
		<h3>Database Implementation<h3>
		<br>- The project aims at building a database of vaccination in Canada from scratch, from creating an Entity-Relation model and
		<br>  converting it to a relational model, to concretely creating tables in DBM2 server using SQL and insert records into them.
		<br>- The database stores information such as vaccination registration, vaccination locations, nurse information, information of
		<br>  every vial performed, etc. The database is essentially a complete system of vaccination records despite some conditions are
		<br>  are omitted for simplicity.
		<br>- After the database is created, an application is developed, with 3 functionalities. The first one is register for a slot to
		<br>  get vaccinated. The next one is to add a person to the database system, and the last one is enter vaccination information of
		<br>  a vial that the person has already taken. The application is built by Java and using SQL to query and write to database.
