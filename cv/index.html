		<h3>Machine Learning via Python</h3>
		<br>
		<br>- Implemented both Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model and Logistic Regression Model to binary classify movie reviews(negative
		<br>  or positive) by analyzing words they use. Both of the models analyzed data from IMDB with length-1000 characteristic
		<br>  vector and achieved an accuracy of 90 percent.
		<br>- Implementing K-Means Model and the Gaussian Mixture Model to cluster data. More specifically, to unsupervisedly learn
		<br>  and label the type of a flower given its characteristc vector(i.e. its length, etc).
		<h3>Database Implementation<h3>
